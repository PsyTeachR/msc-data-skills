The whole [psyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io) team at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology deserves enormous thanks for making it possible and rewarding to teach methods with a focus on reproducibility and open science. Particularly Heather Cleland Woods, Phil McAleer, Helena Paterson, Emily Nordmann, Benedict Jones, and Niamh Stack. We greatly appreciate Iris Holzleitner's volunteer in-class assistance with the first year of this course. We were ever so lucky to get Rebecca Lai as a teaching assistant in the second year; her kind and patient approach to teaching technical skills is an inspiration. Thanks to Daniël Lakens for many inspirational discussions and resources.
