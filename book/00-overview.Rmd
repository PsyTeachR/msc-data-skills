This course provides an overview of skills needed for reproducible research and open science using the statistical programming language R. Students will learn about data visualisation, data tidying and wrangling, archiving, iteration and functions, probability and data simulations, general linear models, and reproducible workflows. Learning is reinforced through weekly assignments that involve working with different types of data.


## Course Aims

This course aims to teach students the basic principles of reproducible research and to provide practical training in data processing and analysis in the statistical programming language R.


## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to:

*	Draw on a range of specialised skills and techniques to formulate a research design appropriate to various kinds of questions in psychology and neuroscience
*	Write scripts in R to organise and transform data sets using best accepted practices
*	Explain basics of probability and its role in statistical inference
*	Critically analyse data and report descriptive and inferential statistics in a reproducible manner

## Course Resources

Each chapter has several short video lectures for the main learning outcomes at the playlist [Data Skills](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA2iRWVwbpTIweEBHD2dOKjZHK1atRmXt){target="_blank"}. The videos are captioned and watching with the captioning on is a useful way to learn the jargon of computational reproducibility. If you cannot access YouTube, the videos are available on the course Moodle and by request from the instructor.

There is a custom package for this course called [dataskills](https://github.com/psyteachr/msc-data-skills){target="_blank"}. You can install it with the code below. It will download all of the packages that are used in the book, along with an offline copy of this book, the shiny apps used in the book, and the exercises.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("psyteachr/msc-data-skills")
```
