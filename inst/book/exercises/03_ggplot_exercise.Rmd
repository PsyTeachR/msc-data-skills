Generate the plots below showing the distribution of dog weight by breed.

```{r dogs}
# do not edit this chunk
# dog weights estimated from http://petobesityprevention.org/ideal-weight-ranges/

set.seed(0) # makes sure random numbers are reproducible

dogs <- tibble(
  breed = rep(c("beagle", "boxer", "bulldog"), each = 100),
  weight = c(
    rnorm(100, 24, 6),
    rnorm(100, 62.5, 12.5),
    rnorm(100, 45, 5)
  )
)

```


## Violin Plot

Make a violin plot with `breed` on the x-axis and `weight` on the y-axis. Make each breed white, 50% transparent, and outlined in a different colour, but omit the legend.

```{r exercise-violin}
dog_violin <- NULL

dog_violin # prints the plot below
```


## Boxplot

Make a boxplot with `breed` on the x-axis and `weight` on the y-axis. Make each breed white, 50% transparent, and outlined in a different colour, but omit the legend.

```{r exercise-boxplot}
dog_boxplot <- NULL

dog_boxplot # prints the plot below
```

## Density plot

Make a density plot with `weight` on the x-axis. Make each breed white, 50% transparent, and outlined in a different colour, but omit the legend.

```{r exercise-density}
dog_density <- NULL

dog_density # prints the plot below
```


## Column Plot

Use `stat_summary` to create a column plot with `breed` on the x-axis and `weight` on the y-axis and error bars showing 1 standard error. Make each breed white, 50% transparent, and outlined in a different colour, but have the error bars be black. Omit the legend.

```{r exercise-column}
dog_column <- NULL

dog_column # prints the plot below
```

## Grid

Create a grid of the four plots above. (Hint: use a function from cowplot).

```{r exercise-grid}
dog_grid <- NULL

dog_grid # prints the plot below
```

## Changing defaults

For the four plots above, change the axis labels so the x-axis reads "Breed of Dog" or "Weight of Dog" (depending on the plot type) and the y-axis reads "Weight of Dog", "Number of Dogs", or "Density of Dogs" (depending on the plot type).

Change the default colours to "orange", "dodgerblue", and "hotpink".

Add a title to each plot describing the plot type.

Save each plot as a PNG file with the names "dog_violin.png", "dog_boxplot.png", "dog_density.png", and "dog_column.png" (the names are important so they show up in the code below).

```{r exercise-save}
# Hint: you can add changes to an existing plot, e.g.:
# dog_density + xlim(0, 100)


```


```{r}
# do not change; displays the images saved above
knitr::include_graphics("dog_violin.png")
knitr::include_graphics("dog_boxplot.png")
knitr::include_graphics("dog_density.png")
knitr::include_graphics("dog_column.png")
```


## Line plot

Represent the relationships among disgust subscales from the dataset [disgust_scores.csv](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/disgust_scores.csv) (or `dataskills::disgust_scores`).

Graph the linear relationship between moral and pathogen disgust. Make sure the axes run from the minimum to maximum possible scores on both axes. Give the graph an appropriate title and axis labels.
  
```{r exercise-lineplot}
disgust_lineplot <- NULL

disgust_lineplot # prints the plot below
```


## Many correlated variables

Create a heatmap of the relationships among all the questions in [disgust_cors.csv](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/disgust_cors.csv)  (or `dataskills::disgust_cors`). The correlations have already been calculated for you. 

*Bonus*: Figure out how to rotate the text on the x-axis so it's readable.

```{r exercise-heatmap}
disgust_heatmap <- NULL

disgust_heatmap # prints the plot below
```

## 2D Density plot

Create a 2d density plot of the relationship between pathogen and sexual disgust for `disgust_scores`. 

Use `stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = "polygon", n = n)`, set n to a value that makes the graph look good, and figure out what it represents.

```{r exercise-density2d}
disgust_density <- NULL

disgust_density # prints the plot below
```

## Facets

Create a grid of plots for the `stroop` dataset from dataskills using faceting. Plot `rt` for each combination of `word` and `ink` to make a 5x5 grid of density plots. Make each plot line the same colour as the ink. For bonus points, make the lines for plots where the ink colour matches the word colour thicker than the other lines.

```{r facets}
word_by_ink <- NULL

word_by_ink # prints the plot below
```

## Advanced Grid

Create a 3x3 grid of linear line plots from `disgust_scores` with columns representing the x-axis and rows representing the y-axis and assign it to `disgust_grid`. Put a density plot of each variable along the diagonal. Make sure the graphs have appropriate titles and axis labels and that the range of the axes are the same in all graphs.

|              | moral   | sexual  | pathogen |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| **moral**    | density | line    | line     | 
| **sexual**   | line    | density | line     |
| **pathogen** | line    | line    | density  |


```{r exercise-cor-advanced}
# Hint: set up your 9 separate plots first

disgust_grid <- NULL

disgust_grid # prints the plot below
```
